# Semantic-Segmentation-Engine-for-Road-Infrastructure


This project implements a deep learning-based semantic segmentation system to identify and label key road components—such as lanes, sidewalks, zebra crossings, and traffic zones—from street-level images. It is designed to support intelligent transportation systems, road monitoring, and urban mobility solutions.

✅ Key Features
🎯 Pixel-level segmentation using DeepLabV3+ with ResNet backbone

🖼 Custom training on annotated road scenes

⚡ FastAPI backend for real-time inference

🖥 React.js dashboard for mask overlay preview

🐳 Dockerized pipeline for scalable deployment

☁️ Compatible with cloud deployment (Azure Container Instances)

🛠 Tech Stack
Python, PyTorch, FastAPI

React.js, Tailwind CSS

Docker, Azure

LabelMe & CVAT for annotation
